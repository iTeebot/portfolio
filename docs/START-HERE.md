## 🎯 Single Site vs Multiple Sites?

**You asked:** Should you create one site or separate sites for each division?

**Our Recommendation:** ✅ **Single Site** (what we built)

### Why This is Better:

1. **Better SEO** - One domain authority vs. split across 4 sites
2. **Easier to maintain** - One codebase, one deployment
3. **Professional** - Shows Teebot as unified organization
4. **Better UX** - Users can explore all services seamlessly
5. **Cost effective** - Single hosting, single domain
6. **Faster development** - You're ready to deploy NOW!

### When to Consider Separate Sites:

- If divisions operate independently
- If you need different branding per division
- If you have different target audiences
- If divisions are in different countries/languages

**For now:** Start with this unified site. You can always split later if needed!
